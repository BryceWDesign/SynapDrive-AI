# 🧠 SynapDrive-AI

**Human-AGI Synergy for Real-Time Physical Control**

A simulated research architecture fusing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) signals with modular Generalized Artificial Intelligence (AGI) to drive safe, interpretable, and autonomous control over physical infrastructure — from next-gen vehicles to aerospace systems and future hyperloops.

> *"A proof-of-concept worthy of serious engineering attention — bridging AGI cognition and real-time control with human intent at the center."*

## 🚀 Purpose

This project is a **technical simulation** of a system that:
- Accepts intent-like signals from hypothetical brain interfaces
- Processes context using vision, memory, and cognitive reasoning
- Routes decisions to simulated control systems
- Logs everything, evaluates performance, and blocks unsafe behavior

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

SynapDrive-AI is structured as a modular cognitive stack:

[Brain Input] ➜ Intent Generator ➜ Cognitive Optimizer ➜ Safety Guard ➜ Decision Router
                                                                                  ⬇
                                                              Episodic Memory ⬅ Meta Evaluator
                                                                                  ⬇
                                                                             Execution Feedback
